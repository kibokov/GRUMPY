    "\n",
    "Once you clone the $\\texttt{GRUMPY}$ repository onto your local machine, within the respository, you will see a file called ``example.ini``. This is the configuration file from where $\\texttt{GRUMPY}$ reads all the relevant model parameter and inputs. The config file contains information on relevant input and output file paths along with the galaxy formation parameters and cosmology parameters. Some of these parameters you will have to vary on a regular basis and some are best left as it is.\n",

    "1) The ```okamoto``` reionization model is our fiducial model for reionization and it is described in detail in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09724) in Section 2.2.2. The key part of this model is that the characteristic halo mass for suppresion in gas accretion ($M_c$) is described by a smooth function that rapidly increases at reionization. The time of sharp increase and the sharpness of that increase is determined by ```zrei``` and ```gamma``` parameter respectively. Refer to the below figure for a visual representation of this. Note that as seen in Figure A1 in our paper, the value for $\\gamma = 15$ is used because it provides best fit to the [Okamoto et al. 2008](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390..920O/abstract) results. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The ```step``` reionization model is a very simplistic model for reionization. Basically, reionization is modeled as a step function where halos above the characteristic mass scale ($M_c$) have no gas accretion (100\\% suppresion) while halos below the characteristic mass scale ($M_c$) accrete gas with full efficiency (0\\% suppresion). The characteristic mass scale ($M_c$) used here is the same as one used in ```okamoto```, with the difference that halos of all masses before ```zrei``` accrete gas with full efficiency. In other words, for $z < z_{\\rm rei}$, we use characteristic mass scale as ```okamoto```, and for $z > z_{\\rm rei}$, we have $M_c = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3)  The ```noreion``` option simply means that there is no reionization, that is, there will be no suppression in gas accretion onto halos due to UV heating of gas.\n",

    "The below figure shows the evolution of the characteristic mass in the ```okamoto``` reionization model for different reionization redshifts $z_{\\rm rei}$ and gamma ($\\gamma$) parameter. One sees that larger the value of $\\gamma$, the sharper the increase in reioniation \n",

    "Note our fiducial model (at the moment) does not follow the individual elemental abundances. Furthermore, the treatment of total metal mass is treated in an approximate fashion in our fiducial model. For instance, one expects there to be a slight metallicity dependence in $y_Z$ and $R_{\\rm loss}$, which we ignore. We are currently working on integrating a more detailed chemical model with $\\texttt{GRUMPY}$ so stay tuned for that!\n",
