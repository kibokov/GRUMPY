# subhalo_randomforest
This code accompanies the paper Modeling the Impact of Baryons on Subhalo Populations with Machine Learning (arxiv.org/abs/1712.04467). It implements a random forest trained on hydrodynamic simulations to classify disrupted and surviving subhalos in dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass host halos.
